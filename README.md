# Self-Balancing-Robot
Designed and developed a two-wheeled self-balancing robot using a PID controller for stability. Implemented sensor fusion with IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for real-time balance adjustments.

# Materials and Components
• Microcontroller: Arduino Uno
• IMU Sensor: MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)
• Motor Driver: L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver
• Motors: 2x Geared DC Motors (100 RPM, 6V)
• Wheels: 2x Plastic wheels
• Power Supply: 3.7V, 360 mAh Lithium-ion battery
• Chassis: Lightweight thermocol-based material (PET derived, recycled from packag-
ing)
• Miscellaneous: Jumper wires, switch, cardboard base
